# Data Structure Projects

Welcome to my Data Structure Projects Repository! 👨‍💻  
This repository is a personal learning showcase containing projects built using fundamental and advanced data structures in C / C++ / Python. 
Each project is designed to apply theoretical concepts to practical problems, reinforcing skills in dynamic memory, linked lists, file handling, and more.

## 📘 Projects Included

### 1. Inverted Research
A file indexing system that builds an **inverted index** from a directory of `.txt` files. 
It allows you to search for words and know in which files they occur, similar to how a search engine works.

#### 🔧 Key Concepts:
- Hash tables
- File parsing and tokenization
- Dynamic memory allocation
- Linked lists

#### ✅ Features:
- Builds an inverted index from multiple text files
- Supports word-based search across files
- Saves and loads index using backup functionality

---

### 2. Arbitrary Precision Calculator
A calculator capable of performing arithmetic operations (+, -, *, /) on **very large integers** beyond the standard `int` or `long` data types by using **linked lists** to store digits.

#### 🔧 Key Concepts:
- Doubly linked lists
- Carry/borrow propagation in arithmetic
- Custom implementation of math operations
- Handling signs and zero edge cases

#### ✅ Features:
- Addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division for large numbers
- Handles numbers with hundreds/thousands of digits
- Command-line interface
